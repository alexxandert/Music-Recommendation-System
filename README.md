# Music-Recommendation-System
Developed a Music recommendation system to suggest tracks based on users listening history and preferences. Utilized Spotify&amp;#39;s API to fetch and update real-time song databases. Leveraged algorithms, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches, to generate music recommendations.
